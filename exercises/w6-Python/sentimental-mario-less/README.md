# Mario/Less

## Problem to Solve

In a file called ```mario.py``` in a folder called ```sentimental-mario-less```, write a program that recreates a half-pyramid using hashes (```#```) for blocks, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1.

- To make things more interesting, first prompt the user for the half-pyramid’s height, a positive integer between ```1``` and ```8```, inclusive.
- If the user fails to provide a positive integer no greater than ```8```, you should re-prompt for the same again.
- Then, generate (with the help of ```print``` and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid.
- Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window.
