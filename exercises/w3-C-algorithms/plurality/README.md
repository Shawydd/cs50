# Plurality

## Problem to Solve

In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.

For this problem, youâ€™ll implement a program that runs a plurality election.

Given a distributed code, complete:

- vote function;
- print_winner function.
