# Volume

## Problem to Solve

Given a distributed code, complete the implementation of ```volume.c```, such that it changes the volume of a sound file by a given factor.

- The program should accept three command-line arguments. The first is ```input```, which represents the name of the original audio file. The second is ```output```, which represents the name of the new audio file that should be generated. The third is ```factor```, which is the amount by which the volume of the original audio file should be scaled.
    - For example, if ```factor``` is ```2.0```, then your program should double the volume of the audio file in ```input``` and save the newly generated audio file in ```output```.
- Your program should first read the header from the input file and write the header to the output file.
- Your program should then read the rest of the data from the WAV file, one 16-bit (2-byte) sample at a time. Your program should multiply each sample by the ```factor``` and write the new sample to the output file.
    - You may assume that the WAV file will use 16-bit signed values as samples. In practice, WAV files can have varying numbers of bits per sample, but weâ€™ll assume 16-bit samples for this problem.
- Your program, if it uses ```malloc```, must not leak any memory.
