# Cash

## Problem to Solve

In a file called ```cash.c``` in a folder called ```cash```, implement a program in C that prints the minimum coins needed to make the given amount of change, in cents, as in the below:
```
Change owed: 25
1
```
But prompt the user for an ```int``` greater than 0, so that the program works for any amount of change:
```
Change owed: 70
4
```
Re-prompt the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than or equal to 0 (or if their input isn’t an ```int``` at all!).

Units to consider: quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢).
